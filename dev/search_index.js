This document is written in the Norg format in its original form and, thus, attempts to be  self-documenting.</p><p>  Please note that this is <b>not</b> a reference implementation - this is an established rule set that  should be strictly followed.</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h1-introduction'>\n<h1 id='h1-introduction'>Introduction</h1>\n<p>  Before diving into the details we will start with an introduction. The Norg file format was  designed as part of the <a href='https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg'>Neorg</a> plugin for Neovim which was  started by <i>Vhyrro (@vhyrro)</i> in April 2021. Soon after starting this work, <i>Max Rossmannek  (@mrossinek)</i> joined the development team, and, with the help of the <a href='#'>Neorg</a> community, the two  have shaped the Norg syntax to what it has become today.</p><section id='section-h2-what-is-norg'>\n<h2 id='h2-what-is-norg'>What is Norg?</h2>\n<p>   The Norg syntax is a <i>structured</i> plain-text file format which aims to be human-readable when   viewed standalone while also providing a suite of markup utilities for typesetting structured   documents. Compared to other plain-text file formats like e.g. Markdown, Org, RST or AsciiDoc, it   sets itself apart most notably by following a strict philosophy to abide by the following simple   rules:</p><ol><li><p><b>Consistency</b> the syntax should be consistent. Even if you know only a part of the syntax,     learning new parts should not be surprising and rather feel predictable and intuitive.</p></li><li><p><b>Unambiguity</b> the syntax should leave <ins>no</ins> room for ambiguity. This is especially motivated by     the use of <a href='https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/'>tree-sitter</a> for the original syntax     parser, which takes a strict left-to-right parsing approach and only has single-character     look-ahead.</p></li><li><p><b><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-form_language'>Free-form</a></b> whitespace is <ins>only</ins> used to     delimit tokens but has no other significance! This is probably the most contrasting feature to     other plain-text formats which often adhere to the     <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-side_rule'>off-side rule</a>, meaning that the syntax relies on     whitespace-indentation to carry meaning.</p></li></ol><p>   Although built with <a href='#'>Neorg</a> in mind, Norg can be utilized in a wide range of applications,   from external note-taking plugins to even messaging applications. Thanks to its <a href='#h1-layers'>layer</a>   system one can choose the feature set they&apos;d like to support and can ignore the higher levels.</p>\n</section>\n\n</section>\n<section id='section-h1-preliminaries'>\n<h1 id='h1-preliminaries'>Preliminaries</h1>\n<p>  First, we define some basic concepts which will be used in this specification.</p><section id='section-h2-characters'>\n<h2 id='h2-characters'>Characters</h2>\n<p>   A Norg file is made up of <i>characters</i>.   A <span id='character'>character</span> is any Unicode <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point'>code point</a> or   <a href='https://www.unicode.org/glossary/#grapheme'>grapheme</a>.</p><section id='section-h3-whitespace'>\n<h3 id='h3-whitespace'>Whitespace</h3>\n<p>    A <a href='#h2-characters'>character</a> is considered <b>whitespace</b> if it is any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>The regular space <code>U+0020</code></p></li><li><p>A tab <code>U+0009</code></p></li><li><p>Any code point in the      <a href='https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/Zs/list.htm'>Unicode Zs general category</a></p></li></ul><p>    Any combination of the above is also considered whitespace.</p><p>    Tabs are not expanded to spaces and since whitespace has no semantic meaning there is no need    to define a default tab stop. However, if a parser must (for implementation reasons) define a    tab stop, we suggest setting it to 4 spaces.</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h3-line-endings'>\n<h3 id='h3-line-endings'>Line Endings</h3>\n<p>    Line endings in Norg serve as a termination character. They are used e.g. to terminate    <a href='#h2-paragraph-segments'>paragraph segments</a>, <a href='#h2-paragraphs'>paragraphs</a> and other elements like the endings of <a href='#h2-range-able-detached-modifiers'>range-able\n    detached modifiers</a>. They are not considered <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a>.</p><p>    The following chars are considered line endings:</p><ul><li><p>A line feed <code>U+000A</code></p></li><li><p>A form feed <code>U+000C</code></p></li><li><p>A carriage return <code>U+000D</code></p></li></ul><p>    The following line ending combinations are permitted:</p><ul><li><p>A single line feed</p></li><li><p>A single carriage return</p></li><li><p>A carriage return immediately followed by a line feed</p></li></ul>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h3-punctuation'>\n<h3 id='h3-punctuation'>Punctuation</h3>\n<p>    A <a href='#h2-characters'>character</a> is considered <b>punctuation</b> if it is any of the following:</p><ul><li><p>A standard ASCII punctuation character: <code>!&quot;#$%&amp;&apos;()*+,-./:;&lt;=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~</code></p></li><li><p>Anything in the general Unicode categories <code>Pc</code>, <code>Pd</code>, <code>Pe</code>, <code>Pf</code>, <code>Pi</code>, <code>Po</code> or <code>Ps</code>.</p></li></ul>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h3-escaping'>\n<h3 id='h3-escaping'>Escaping</h3>\n<p>    A single <a href='#h2-characters'>character</a> can be escaped if it is immediately preceded by a backslash,    <code>\\</code> (<code>U+005C</code>). Any <a href='#h2-characters'>character</a> may be escaped <i>apart from</i> <a href='#h2-characters'>characters</a>    within free-form and ranged verbatim segments (see <a href='#h2-free-form-attached-modifiers'>free-form attached modifiers</a> and    <a href='#h3-verbatim-ranged-tags'>verbatim ranged tags</a>).    For more information about precedence, take a look at the <a href='#h1-precedence'>precedence</a> section.</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h3-regular-characters'>\n<h3 id='h3-regular-characters'>Regular Characters</h3>\n<p>    Any other character not described by the preceding sections is treated as a generic code    point/character.</p>\n</section>\n\n</section>\n<section id='section-h2-words'>\n<h2 id='h2-words'>Words</h2>\n<p>   The Norg format is designed to be parsed on a word-by-word basis from left-to-right through the   entire document <i>in a single pass</i>. This is possible because the language is <a href='#'>free-form</a>, meaning   that whitespace has no semantic meaning, and because the markup follows strict rules which are   outlined in the later sections of this document.</p><p>   A <b>word</b> is considered to be any combination of <a href='#h2-characters'>characters</a> which are neither   <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> nor <a href='#h3-punctuation'>punctuation</a> (see <a href='#h3-regular-characters'>regular characters</a>).</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h2-paragraph-segments'>\n<h2 id='h2-paragraph-segments'>Paragraph Segments</h2>\n<p>   <a href='#h2-words'>Words</a> are first combined into <b>paragraph segments</b>. A paragraph segment may then contain any   inline element of type:</p><ul><li><p><a href='#h1-attached-modifiers'>attached modifiers</a></p></li><li><p><a href='#h1-linkables'>linkables</a></p></li></ul><p>   Usually, a <a href='#h3-line-endings'>line ending</a> terminates the paragraph segment.   This means that a paragraph segment is for the most part just a line of text:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           I am a paragraph segment.\n   I am another paragraph segment.\n   Together we form a paragraph.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>   The exception to the rule is whenever a linkable or attached modifier within the paragraph   segment spans more than a single line, in which case the paragraph segment also spans that   distance.

Norg allows for you to extend its syntax and define data  within clear boundaries - it does this using tags.</p><p>  <b>NOTE</b> Tags are the <i>only</i> way that extensions may be made to the format.</p><p>  There are 6 different tag types, each with their own way of changing the way text in Norg is  interpreted. Before we discuss those, however, we should discuss the syntax rules for tags:</p><ul><li><p>A tag is similar to a <a href=''>detached modifier</a> in the sense that it must begin    at the beginning of a line with optional <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> (but nothing else) preceding it.</p></li><li><p>After that you will encounter a special tag character (<code>=</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>@</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>.</code>), <i>none</i>    of which are attached modifiers (see <a href='#fn_disambiguating-tags-and-attached-modifiers'><sup id='fnref_disambiguating-tags-and-attached-modifiers'>disambiguating tags and attached modifiers</sup></a>). The    special tag character is then <i>immediately</i> followed by text, which becomes the <i>tag name</i>. Said    tag name can consist of any <a href=''>regular character</a> and/or <code>-</code> and <code>_</code>.</p></li><li><p>Tags can have their names delimited by a <code>.</code> in order to create a &quot;hierarchy&quot;, e.g.    <code>document.meta</code>.</p></li><li><p>    After a <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> character any number of parameters on the same line may follow:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            #tag-name.subtag parameter1 parameter2\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>    By default parameters are space-separated. In order to create multi-word parameters, you may    escape the space character with a backslash (<code>`).\n    |example\n    #tag-name.subtag parameter1 with spaces parameter2\n    |end\n    Parameters may consist of any character (apart from a {*** line endings}[line ending], of course).\n    ---\n\n  ^ Disambiguating tags and attached modifiers\n    If tag characters were attached modifier openers there would be no way to know whether the\n    character is an attached modifier opener or a tag opener until the whole line has been parsed;\n    in other words, such a scenario would entail a difficult to resolve ambiguity.\n\n  Norg provides several inbuilt tag names that are reserved, but their details are not explained\n  in this specification - this document strictly covers syntax - see the [semantics document] for a\n  list of the built-in tags. There is no restriction in regard to the length of a tag name, nor are\n  there any disallowed names that a parser should omit (unless they don&apos;t adhere to the above rules\n  regarding tag names).\n\n** Ranged Tags\n   Ranged tags are a way to express custom information within a range.\n   They begin with the traditional tag declaration and are ended with an `end</code> statement.</p><p>   The <code>end</code> statement has a simple rule set:</p></li><li><p>Must be at the start of a line, may be preceded by any <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> (but nothing else)</p></li><li><p>Must use the same prefix as its parent (in the case of standard ranged tags: <code>|</code>; in the case     of verbatim tags: <code>@</code>; for macro tags: <code>=</code>)</p></li><li><p>Must <b>immediately</b> be succeeded by a <a href='#h3-line-endings'>line ending</a>.</p></li></ul><section id='section-h3-macro-tags'>\n<h3 id='h3-macro-tags'>Macro Tags</h3>\n<p>    Macro tags (also known as <i>macro definitions</i>) are a tag type designed to declare and define    macros. Macros are templates that can be executed with parameters in order to place some    structured text into the document.</p><p>    The content of the macro tag is <i>any</i> Norg markup - this includes <a href='#h2-structural-detached-modifiers'>structural detached\n    modifiers</a> and nested <a href='#h1-tags'>tags</a>. The macro tag is closed with the <code>=end</code> statement.</p><p>    Under the hood, all other <a href='#h1-tags'>tag</a> types are implemented as macros with special parameters    and contents.</p><p>    The following is an example of a macro:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            =see url\n    (see {&amp;url&amp;})\n    =end\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    It can then be invoked using any of the other tag types, for example the <a href='#h2-infirm-tag'>infirm tag</a>:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            This is a recipe for a cake\n    .see https://wikipedia.com/some-cool-cake-recipe\n    \\- let&apos;s begin cooking!\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    After macro expansion, this is what the document would look like:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            This is a recipe for a cake\n    (see {https://wikipedia.com/some-cool-cake-recipe})\n    \\- let&apos;s begin cooking!\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>    Which, when reformatted, would look (and render) like so:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            This is a recipe for a cake (see {https://wikipedia.com/some-cool-cake-recipe}) - let&apos;s begin\n    cooking!\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<section id='section-h3-standard-ranged-tags'>\n<h3 id='h3-standard-ranged-tags'>Standard Ranged Tags</h3>\n<p>    There are times when you may want to create an isolated block of Norg markup.    To do this you may use the standard ranged tag, which uses the <code>|</code> character.</p><p>    Currently, it is only used for four tags, <code>comment</code>, <code>example</code>, <code>details</code> and <code>group</code></p><ul><li><p>The <code>comment</code> ranged tag is used for long strings of comments (versus the <code>%</code> null attached      modifier, which is mostly used for short comments).</p></li><li><p>The <code>example</code> tag is a simple way to show an example of some Norg markup without it being      rendered and treated as physical markup (most commonly used throughout this very document to      show unrendered examples of Norg syntax).</p></li><li><p>The <code>details</code> tag is a way to hide away markup (just like      <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details'><code>&lt;details></code></a> in HTML).</p></li><li><p>The <code>group</code> tag may be used to group together many elements and apply a global <a href='#h3-strong-carryover-tags'>strong carryover tag</a> to each one of them.</p></li></ul><section id='section-h4-examples'>\n<h4 id='h4-examples'>Examples</h4>\n<p>     <code>example`:\n     |example\n     |example\n     * This is an example heading.\n     |end\n     |end\n\n     `|comment`:\n     |example\n     |comment\n     This is a very long comment with some content\n     and with some markup!\n\n     * Heading\n       /italic/ and *bold*.\n     |end\n     |end\n\n     `|details`:\n     |example\n     |details\n     * Here is some hidden markup!\n       Wowzers.\n     |end\n     |end\n\n     `|group`:\n     |example\n     #color red\n     |group\n     This will be red.\n\n     So will this.\n\n     * So will this\n       And this.\n     |end\n     |end\n\n**** Edge Cases and Semantic Interpretation\n     A commonly arising question is &quot;how are these interpreted at parse time?&quot; - can you link to\n     elements within `|comment` tags? What governs the behavior of these differing tags?\n\n     The answer may be illustrated simply by showing how these tags are implemented.\n     As mentioned in the {*** macro tags} section, all tag types (apart from the macro tag) are a\n     macro invocation under the hood. Below are the implementations for `|comment` and `|group`,\n     respectively:\n     - :\n       |example\n       =comment ...\n       =end\n       |end\n     - :\n       |example\n       =group ...\n       &amp;...&amp;\n       =end\n       |end\n\n     The `|comment` tag evaluates to /no value/. Anything that is placed within a comment during\n     invocation (the `...` parameter) is simply dropped. Because of this it is *not* possible to\n     link to elements within comment tags. The `|group` tag returns everything that you give\n     it, because of this it *is* possible to freely link to any element within a `|group`.\n\n     To summarize - the behavior of each individual standard ranged tag is fully governed by its\n     implementation - see the [semantics document] for more details.\n\n*** Verbatim Ranged Tags\n    In other cases you may be more interested in an isolated block /without/ Norg markup (i.e. a\n    /verbatim/ block). A prime example of this is `@code`, which creates a code block - you\n    obviously don&apos;t want nested Norg syntax within that! Note how in the following example the\n    `@MyAnnotation` would clash with Norg&apos;s verbatim ranged tag syntax, but doesn&apos;t as no nested\n    markup is allowed within:\n    @code java\n    @MyAnnotation(name=&quot;someName&quot;, value=&quot;Hello World&quot;)\n    public class TheClass {\n      // ...\n    }\n    @end\n    This ranged tag type is the most commonly used one as it has the widest range of applications.\n    The {*** standard ranged tags}[standard ranged tag] is a much more niche syntax element targeted\n    at specific use cases.\n\n** Carryover Tags\n   Carryover tags are a construct used to assign certain properties to the next item or whole\n   {# objects}[object].\n\n   /Note/: Internally, they are a type of {** macro tags}[macro tag], where the next element is given\n   as the last parameter to the macro. For more info see {*** macro tags} and the [semantics document].\n\n   There are two types of carryover tag, the {*** weak carryover tags}[weak carryover tag] and the\n   {*** strong carryover tags}[strong variant].\n\n*** Weak Carryover Tags\n    The weak carryover tag affects the next element and next element /only/. It does not work with\n    whole collections of elements (see {*** strong carryover tags}).\n\n    Weak carryover tags only apply to the next element; their behavior is as follows:\n    - When the element has children, the weak carryover tag only applies to the single item (it does\n      not carry over to its children).\n    - When the element is part of an {# object}, no items other than the one below the weak\n      carryover tag is affected.\n    - An exception is made when a weak carryover tag is applied to an {# indent segment} or a\n      {** ranged tags}[ranged tag], in which case everything within that segment/tag is affected.\n\n**** Examples\n     Only the second item is affected:\n     |example\n     - List item 1\n     +color red\n     - List item 2 (which is red)\n     - List item 3 (which is normal-colored)\n     |end\n\n     Only the `Heading 1` and `This is some content` text is highlighted:\n     |example\n     +color red\n     * Heading 1 (which is red)\n       This is some content. (which is still red)\n     ** Heading 2 (which is normal-colored)\n        This is also some content. (which is normal-colored)\n     |end\n\n     Special behavior for indent segments:\n     |example\n     - List item 1\n     +color red\n     - List item 2 (which is red)\n     -- But this isn&apos;t red\n     -- Neither is this\n     +color green\n     - ::\n       This is green.\n\n       -- This is also green\n       -- And so is this.\n       ---\n     |end\n\n*** Strong Carryover Tags\n    Contrary to its {*** weak carryover tags}[weak variant], the strong carryover tag exists to\n    annotate an entire {# object} versus just a single item. Its behavior is opposite to its weak\n    counterpart, namely:\n    - When the element has children, the strong carryover tag applies to both the whole item and all\n      of its children.\n    - When the element is part of an {# object}, all items in the object are affected.\n\n**** Examples\n     A nice use case is the `#choice` carryover tag, which converts all items in a list into a\n     single-choice question with right/wrong answers:\n     |example\n     What is your favorite activity? Hint: there&apos;s only one correct answer :)\n     #choice\n     - ( ) Sleeping\n     - ( ) Learning\n     - (x) Writing `.norg` documents\n     |end\n\n     Here, both the level 1 heading and the level 2 heading along with their contents will be\n     colored red:\n     |example\n     #color red\n     * Heading 1\n       This is some content.\n     ** Heading 2\n        This is also some content.\n     |end\n\n*** Carryover Tags and Paragraphs\n    A feature of {** carryover tags} which we have not discussed yet is how they interact with\n    {** paragraphs} (and {** paragraph segments}). The following simple rules apply:\n    - {*** strong carryover tags} affect the next {** paragraphs}[paragraph]\n    - {*** weak carryover tags} affect the next {** paragraph segments}[paragraph segment]\n\n    For example:\n    |example\n    #color blue\n    This entire paragraph\n    will now appear in blue\n    color.\n\n    This next paragraph is normal-colored.\n    +color red\n    But this single line is colored red,\n    whereas this line is normal-colored again.\n\n    #color blue\n    This part is blue,\n    +color red\n    but the latter carryover tag takes precedence, making this part red,\n    and this part blue again, since the weak carryover tag does not affect this segment.\n    |end\n\n** Infirm Tag\n   The infirm tag is the simplest form of executing a macro. It is a single-line, embeddable macro\n   invocation with the ability to supply parameters. It is denoted with the `.` character.\n\n   Below is an example:\n   |example\n   =LoremIpsum\n   Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut\n   labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris\n   nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

Attached modifiers encapsulate some text within a\n  {** paragraphs}[paragraph] and change the way it is displayed in the document.\n  An attached modifier consists of two parts: the /opening modifier/ and the /closing modifier/.\n\n  Below are the general rules for attached modifiers:\n  - An opening modifier may only be preceded by {# whitespace} or {# punctuation}\n  - An opening modifier may _NOT_ be succeeded by {# whitespace}\n  - A closing modifier may _NOT_ be preceded by {# whitespace}\n  - A closing modifier may only be succeeded by {# whitespace} or {# punctuation}\n  +name attached modifier range\n  - ::\n    {* Attached modifiers} can only span at maximum a single {# paragraphs}[paragraph], i.e. they get\n    terminated as soon as they encounter a {$ paragraph break}.\n\n    This means that this:\n    |example\n    *this\n\n    text*\n    |end\n    will *not* result in any bold text, as it&apos;s divided by a {$ paragraph break}.\n    However, this:\n    |example\n    *this\n    text*\n    |end\n    is fine, and will result in *`this text`* being bold.\n  - Nested {* attached modifiers} should be closed in the opposite order they were opened.\n  - Two or more consecutive attached modifiers of the same type (i.e. `**`, `//` etc.) should be\n    instantly &quot;disqualified&quot; and parsed as raw text in /all/ circumstances and without any\n    exceptions.\n\n  Their name should be rather self-explanatory - both the opening and closing modifier are\n  /attached/ to one another.\n\n  The following attached modifiers exist and have respective meaning:\n  - \\*bold\\*: *bold*\n  - \\/italic\\/: /italic/\n  - \\_underline\\_: _underline_\n  - \\-strike-through\\-: -strike-through-\n  - \\!spoiler\\!: !spoiler!\n  - \\^superscript\\^: ^superscript^ (cannot be nested into `subscript`)\n  - \\,subscript\\,: ,subscript, (cannot be nested into `superscript`)\n  - \\`inline code\\`: `inline code` (disables any nested markup - verbatim)\n  - \\%{** Null Modifier}[null modifier]\\%: %null modifier%\n  - \\$inline math\\$: $f(x) = y$ (verbatim)\n  - \\&amp;variable\\&amp;: &amp;variable&amp; (verbatim)\n\n** Valid Examples\n   |example\n   *Bold text*\n\n   *Bold text*,\n   .*Bold text*,\n\n   *Bold\n   text*\n\n   */Bold and italic/* &lt;- closing modifiers closed in the opposite order they were opened\n   */Bold and italic/ and only bold*\n\n   Text */with/ _different_ ^markup^ !types!*\n   |end\n\n** Invalid Examples\n   |example\n   * Bold text *\n\n   *Bold text *\n\n   other text*Bold text*\n\n   *Bold text*other text\n\n   *\n   Bold text*\n\n   *Bold\n   text\n   *\n\n   *Bold\n\n   text*\n\n   Closed in the wrong order:\n   */Bold and italic*/\n\n   Also closed in the wrong order:\n   */Bold and italic* and only italic/\n   |end\n\n** Null Modifier\n   This section expands a bit on the concept of the `%null modifier%` in order to understand\n   some of its use cases.\n\n   When used in a standalone fashion, the null modifier nullifies (removes) all of the text inside.\n   This means that on its own it behaves like a comment, which is never rendered:\n   |example\n   Cats %TODO: create section about cats% are very cute animals.\n   |end\n\n   In higher {* layers}, this modifier can have its behaviour extended with the {** attached modifier\n   extensions}[attached modifier extension] syntax, which essentially makes it a configurable\n   modifier suit for many occasions. For example, if you wanted to make an arbitrary part of your\n   text red, you may do:\n   |example\n   This part of the text is %colored red%(color:red)!\n   |end\n\n** Variables\n   Variables are a {** layer 5} attached modifier that allow a user to invoke a macro without any\n   parameters and place the result inside e.g. a paragraph. For more information on their\n   behavior see the [semantics document].\n\n** Free-form Attached Modifiers\n   Even with all the rules described in the above sections there are still some evident limitations\n   with attached modifiers, namely:\n   - Arbitrary {*** whitespace} within {* attached modifiers} is not permitted: `*  bold  *` is\n     invalid and thus not bold.\n   - Representing verbatim attached modifier chars within the corresponding verbatim blocks is not\n     possible: `</code>I cannot place a (<code>) char inside here without accidentally terminating the\n     block.|</code>.</p><p>   Free-form modifiers fix this with a special syntax to specify the beginning and end of a ranged   block. For example:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           Here, I can write `| leading and trailing whitespace (with a ` char)  |` within a verbatim block\n   without accidentally terminating it.\n\n   Here, I can use a literal `$` inside inline math: $| 10$ + 10$ = 20$ |$.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>   The use of pipes is special because the position of the pipe (i.e. whether it&apos;s before or after the   attached modifier) can unambiguously tell us whether that symbol is an opening attached modifier   or a closing one. It&apos;s thanks to this that whitespace is freely allowed within its content.</p><p>   Aside from the details described above, free-form attached modifiers have the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>Backslashes (<code>`) are treated as verbatim and do not mean an {*** escaping}[escape sequence]\n     (see {* precedence}).\n   - Despite being called &quot;free-form&quot; they can still only span a single paragraph (see {# attached\n     modifier range}).\n\n** Link Modifier\n   The link modifier, `:</code>, is a special modifier type - it puts a twist on the original attached   modifier rules - in fact, it&apos;s the polar opposite.</p></li></ul><p>   As described in the <a href='#h1-attached-modifiers'>attached modifiers</a> section, attached modifier types may not exist   in between words like so:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           abso/freaking/lutely!\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>   It&apos;s entirely plausible to want to do this however, which is why the <a href='#h2-link-modifier'>link   modifier</a> was devised. With it, you can bridge attached modifiers and regular text together:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           abso:/freaking/:lutely!\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>   It is important to note that link modifiers do not need to occur in pairs. This:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           Ex:*ample* text\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>   Will also result in <code>ample</code> becoming <b>bold</b>. In fact, using a link modifier at the end will not   give the desired result (it will be rendered as a regular <code>:</code> char). To understand why keep   reading.</p><p>   Through the examples above it is evident that there are two link modifier types: one where the   link modifier is an <i>opening</i> link modifier (i.e. it appears before an opening attached modifier)   and one where it&apos;s a <i>closing</i> link modifier (i.e. it appears after a closing attached modifier).   This distinction is visible even when they don&apos;t occur in pairs.</p><p>   In the case that the link modifier is opening (the attached modifier appears on the right):</p><ul><li><p>The link modifier may only be preceded by a <a href=''>regular character</a>     (or, in other words, may <i>not</i> be preceded by a <a href='#h3-punctuation'>punctuation</a> character nor by a     <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> character).</p></li><li><p>The link modifier may only be succeeded by an opening attached modifier.</p></li></ul><p>   In the case that the link modifier is closing (the attached modifier appears on the left):</p><ul><li><p>The link modifier may only be preceded by a closing attached modifier.</p></li><li><p>The link modifier may only be succeeded by a <a href=''>regular character</a>.</p></li></ul><p>   If the above conditions are not met, then the character should be treated as a literal <code>:</code>.</p><section id='section-h2-attached-modifier-extensions'>\n<h2 id='h2-attached-modifier-extensions'>Attached Modifier Extensions</h2>\n<p>   Similarly to <a href='#h2-detached-modifier-extensions'>detached modifier extensions</a>, attached modifier extensions serve as a way   to attach metadata to <a href='#h1-attached-modifiers'>attached modifiers</a>.   The metadata that you can attach, however, differs from <a href='#h2-detached-modifier-extensions'>detached modifier extensions</a>, as they   serve different use cases.</p><p>   The content of attached modifier extensions consists of a set of references to many   <a href='#h3-attributes'>attributes</a>. These attributes are delimited by the <a href='#h1-contextual-delimiter'>contextual `|` delimiter</a>.   If the attribute is part of a hierarchy (see <a href='#h3-attributes'>attributes</a>), you may use the <code>:</code>   character to link them together. Some inbuilt attributes are the <code>lang</code> and <code>color</code> hierarchies   (a comprehensive list can be found in the <a href='#'>semantics document</a>).</p><section id='section-h3-examples'>\n<h3 id='h3-examples'>Examples</h3>\n<pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            `print(&quot;This is some python&quot;)`(lang:python) &lt;- The lang:python attribute highlights the text as python\n    *some green and bold text!*(color:green)    &lt;- some green and bold text\n\n    {* Link location}[this is an important link](important|color:red) &lt;- Highlights the link as big,\n                                                                         bold (important) and red.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n\n</section>\n<section id='section-h1-contextual-delimiter'>\n<h1 id='h1-contextual-delimiter'>Contextual <code>|</code> Delimiter</h1>\n<p>  The pipe (<code>|</code>) character is a really nice character - it can be applied to many problems  and expressively represent certain behaviors, specifically <i>delimiting</i>. While also used for  <a href='#h3-standard-ranged-tags'>standard ranged tags</a> and <a href='#h2-free-form-attached-modifiers'>free-form attached modifiers</a>, the pipe symbol is also used as  a delimiter for <a href='#h2-detached-modifier-extensions'>detached</a> and <a href='#h2-attached-modifier-extensions'>attached</a> modifier extensions. Even though it&apos;s used 3 times for different purposes,  the contexts in which they are used in allows for them to be unambiguous. It also keeps intent  consistent across the format.</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h1-intersecting-modifiers'>\n<h1 id='h1-intersecting-modifiers'>Intersecting Modifiers</h1>\n<p>  Norg is a syntax designed to be used by many - this includes many styles and preferences. Although  it&apos;s impossible to satisfy everyone, there are some variations of syntax that can be used to  &quot;beautify&quot; Norg markup.  The intersecting modifier does just that - it&apos;s a way to intersect two different paragraph  segments (and <b>only</b> paragraph segments) together on the same line.</p><p>  The syntax is as follows:</p><ul><li><p>First, a <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> character must be matched</p></li><li><p>Next, the actual modifier (currently only <code>:</code>) must be matched.</p></li><li><p>The token ends with another <a href='#h3-whitespace'>whitespace</a> character.</p></li></ul><p>  The use case for the intersecting modifier is best illustrated by example:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n          $ Term\n    This is a definition of that term.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>  This is perfectly normal syntax that you would write day to day in Norg. But what if you&apos;re more  of a fan of one-liners? The <code> : </code> intersecting modifier (currently the only modifier of this  type) can be used to do just this:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n          $ Term : This is a definition of that term.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>  This syntax is especially favored for <a href='#h3-table-cells'>table cells</a>:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n          : A1 : Content of the cell at A1\n  : A2 : Content of the cell at A2\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>  The <code> : </code> syntax expands to a newline, which means that after expansion you get:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n          : A1\n  Content of the cell at A1\n  : A2\n  Content of the cell at A2\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<section id='section-h1-linkables'>\n<h1 id='h1-linkables'>Linkables</h1>\n<p>  Finally, there is one more kind of inline syntax which is the <a href=''>linkables</a> kind.  Linkables can link to any element <i>anywhere</i> in the document.</p><p>  When resolving links, the first match should always be the only match, starting from the top of  the document and heading towards the bottom. This means that if there are two matches, the one at  the topmost part of the document should be chosen as the target.</p><p>  Linkables are comprised of many segments, and can change meaning depending on the order those  segments were defined in.</p><p>  Linkables are essentially a more lenient version of the <a href='#h1-attached-modifiers'>attached modifier</a> syntax. Below are the rules for linkables:</p><ul><li><p>An opening modifier may be instantly succeeded with anything <i>but</i> a <a href=''>line ending</a>.</p></li><li><p>A closing modifier may <b>not</b> be preceded by a <a href=''>line ending</a>.</p></li></ul><p>  Below are a few examples of invalid linkables:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n          this is not a {\n  * linkable}\n\n  nor is this a [linkable\n  ]\n\n  &lt;\n  this certainly isn&apos;t a linkable\n  >\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>  <b>An unclosed linkable may be treated as an error in the resulting syntax tree</b>.</p><section id='section-h2-link-location'>\n<h2 id='h2-link-location'>Link Location</h2>\n<p>   The link location is defined through curly braces (<code>{}</code>) and contains the physical location   that the user would like to link to. Inside these curly braces you can find one (or more; with   limited inter-compatibility) of the following types of data:</p><ul><li><p>A <a href=''>file location</a></p></li><li><p>A <a href=''>line number</a></p></li><li><p>A <a href='#h3-url'>URL</a> (most commonly to an external resource)</p></li><li><p>A <a href=''>detached modifier</a> followed by the name of the linkable</p><ul><li><p><a href=''>nestable detached modifiers</a> can<b>NOT</b> be linked to</p></li></ul></li><li><p>A <a href=''>custom detached modifier</a> specifically made for links (<code>/</code>,     <code>#</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>=</code>)</p></li><li><p>A <a href='#h4-timestamps'>timestamp</a></p></li></ul><section id='section-h3-file-location'>\n<h3 id='h3-file-location'>File Location</h3>\n<p>    The file location is a construct that allows you to specify the <i>target file</i> into which you    want to link to. This allows you to <b>link to targets within other files</b> or just link to other    Norg files entirely.</p><p>    When standalone, the link syntax will simply point to another <code>.norg</code> file relative to the    current file the link is contained in:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {:path/to/other-file:}\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    Note that you do <b>not</b> provide the <code>.norg</code> extension within the path.<div class='name-path-modifiers'>    You may use traditional modifiers in your path, like <code>/</code> (in e.g. <code>/my/file</code>) to signify the</div>    root of your file system, <code>~</code> (in e.g. <code>~/Documents/my-file</code>) to signify the current user&apos;s home    directory, <i>or</i> you can use the <a href='#'>Neorg</a>-specific <code>$</code> (in e.g. <code>$/my/file</code>) to signify the <ins>root</ins>    of the <a href='#'>Neorg</a> workspace.    Since not all Norg files will be used strictly by <a href='#'>Neorg</a>, the workspace root can be    implementation-specific - for git repos the workspace root could be simply the root of the    repository, and for other note-taking apps it could simply be the root of the directory where    all the notes are stored.    A file location may <i>only</i> be accompanied by a <a href=''>detached modifier</a>, <a href=''>line number</a> or <a href=''>the magic char</a>, in which case the links look like so:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {:path/to/file:123}\n    {:path/to/file:# Location within that file}\n    {:path/to/file:** Level 2 heading}\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    <code>/</code>, <code>@</code> and URLs are not allowed in combination with file locations:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {:path:/ file} &lt;- invalid\n    {:path:@ timestamp} &lt;- invalid\n    {:path:https://my-url} &lt;- also invalid\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<section id='section-h3-line-number'>\n<h3 id='h3-line-number'>Line Number</h3>\n<p>    You can also link to a set line number within the current (or other Norg) file.</p><p>    The syntax is as follows:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            Line 1\n    Line 2\n\n    This is a reference to line {2}.\n    This is a reference to line {:file:4} in a different file.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    Disambiguating line numbers and URIs is quite simple - URIs do not begin with digits.</p><section id='section-h3-url'>\n<h3 id='h3-url'>URL</h3>\n<p>    You can define a link to an external resource by simply putting in the URL:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg}\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    Actions related to schemas like <code>https://</code>, <code>ftp://</code> etc. (when attempting to open the link) are    handled by a lower level component running Norg, e.g. <a href='#'>Neorg</a> or the underlying Operating    System.</p><section id='section-h3-detached-modifier'>\n<h3 id='h3-detached-modifier'>Detached Modifier</h3>\n<p>    Norg allows you to link to any <a href='#h2-structural-detached-modifiers'>structural</a> or    <a href='#h2-range-able-detached-modifiers'>range-able</a> detached modifier:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            * I am a level 1 heading\n\n    Strict link to a level 1 heading:\n    {* I am a level 1 heading}\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    The inside of the link location looks just like a detached modifier definition, and that is    because it pretty much is. You can substitute the <code>*</code> char for any other    <a href='#h2-structural-detached-modifiers'>structural</a> or <a href='#h2-range-able-detached-modifiers'>range-able</a>    detached modifier, <i>except</i> &quot;ranged&quot; versions of said modifiers - those are <b>disallowed</b> within    the link syntax. By this we mean that syntax like <code>{$$ Text}</code> is <ins>invalid</ins>. To link to a ranged    definition you would still use <code>{$ Text}</code>, there is no reason to make a distinction between a    ranged and non-ranged detached modifier as both have the same meaning, one just allows more    content to exist within itself.</p><section id='section-h3-custom-detached-modifiers'>\n<h3 id='h3-custom-detached-modifiers'>Custom Detached Modifiers</h3>\n<p>    Apart from linking to the detached modifiers outlined above, you can also link to a set of    custom modifiers specifically designed for links. These are the <code>#</code> (magic), <code>/</code> (file), <code>@</code>    (timestamp), <code>?</code> (wiki link) and <code>=</code> (extended) linkable locations.</p><section id='section-h4-the-magic-char'>\n<h4 id='h4-the-magic-char'>The Magic Char (<code>#</code>)</h4>\n<p>     Sometimes you simply want to be lazy, or you want to link to an <a href=''>inline     linkable</a> that does not have a dedicated modifier to denote it - in these scenarios you would     use the magic char: <code>#</code>. It links to <i>any</i> item type.

In that case you may use <code>{/ /path/to/my/file.txt}</code> (notice the mandatory space after the <code>/</code>     char, just like with the <a href=''>detached modifier</a>s). Paths are relative to the Norg file that     contains the link unless started with a <code>/</code> to denote your file system root.</p><p>     In addition to just providing a path, you may also specify a line number at the end via a colon <code>:</code>.     Example:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n             {/ my-file.txt:123} &lt;- This is a link to `my-file.txt` at line 123\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>     As with the <a href='#h3-file-location-path-modifiers'>path modifier</a> syntax, the file linkable     also supports special characters like <code>~</code> for the user&apos;s home directory and the special <code>$</code>     character to denote the root of the current workspace.</p><section id='section-h4-timestamps'>\n<h4 id='h4-timestamps'>Timestamps (<code>@</code>)</h4>\n<p>     The syntax for timestamps within links is the same as the syntax used in the     <a href='#h4-timestamp-extension'>timestamp extension</a>.</p><p>     Example:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n             Frank&apos;s birthday is on {@ 5th May}.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<section id='section-h4-wiki-links'>\n<h4 id='h4-wiki-links'>Wiki Links (<code>?</code>)</h4>\n<p>     When building large knowledge bases it&apos;s sensible to want to quickly create links between files     without worrying about the location of said file. The <b>wiki link</b> allows you to link to any     heading in any file in the current workspace.

Using the <code>/</code> syntax also disallows you from       accessing items within the file.</p></li><li><p><code>{file://my/file.norg}</code> is simply utilizing the <code>file://</code> schema to access a file. This       isn&apos;t <i>the</i> recommended way to link to files, but it exists simply because of URI schemas.</p></li></ol>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h3-scoping'>\n<h3 id='h3-scoping'>Scoping</h3>\n<p>    Within linkables it is possible to narrow down the search of the link via the <code> : </code> scoping    modifier. This modifier can exist because under normal circumstances when parsing e.g. the title    of a heading a <code> : </code> sequence of characters would be considered an <a href='#h1-intersecting-modifiers'>intersecting modifier</a>.</p><p>    Below is an example of the scoping modifier in use:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {* Heading Name : *** Level 3 heading}\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>    The search narrows the search to a <code>Level 3 heading</code> <i>within</i> a level 1 heading called <code>Heading\n    Name</code>. This search is descending in terms of nesting, in other words, you <i>cannot</i> do    <code>{*** Heading3 : * Heading1}</code>.</p><p>    This scoping is not limited to any item type. You are free to perform searches like    <code>{$ Definition : $ Nested Definition : ^ Footnote}</code>, which searches for a footnote within a    definition called <code>Nested Definition</code> within a definition called <code>Definition</code>.</p><section id='section-h2-link-description'>\n<h2 id='h2-link-description'>Link Description</h2>\n<p>   Link descriptions are denoted by square brackets: <code>[]</code>. They contain the description for either a   <a href=''>link location</a> (by placing the description after the link location or an anchor declaration),   an <a href=''>anchor</a> definition (by placing the description before the link location) or an   anchor declaration (where the <i>only</i> syntax item <b>is</b> the link description). Anchors are   described <a href=''>later on</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h2-links'>\n<h2 id='h2-links'>Links</h2>\n<p>   Links in Norg can exist as a standalone <a href=''>link location</a> in which case their text is used as   the link title (often makes sense for headings):</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           {* I am a standalone link}\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>   When a custom description is required, it must be placed <b><ins>after</ins></b> the link location. This makes   sense in terms of writing as you first define where you link to, and then annotate it afterwards:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           Click {* I am a link}[here] to find out more.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<section id='section-h2-anchors'>\n<h2 id='h2-anchors'>Anchors</h2>\n<p>   Norg also has a concept called <b>anchors</b>. These allow you to place a standalone   <a href='#h2-link-description'>link description</a> inside of text (referred to as an <span id='anchor-declaration'>anchor declaration</span>).   The target which this anchor links to can then be <ins>defined</ins> at another place in the document   with an <span id='anchor-definition'>anchor definition</span> which is an initial <a href='#h2-link-description'>link description</a> followed by a   <a href='#h2-link-location'>link location</a>. This is especially useful when you want to link to the same target very   often, like for example a specific website.</p><p>   Below are a few usage examples:</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           [Neorg] is a fancy organizational tool for everyone.\n\n   I like shilling [Neorg]{https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg} sorry :(\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n<p>   Here, we <i>declare</i> the anchor once at the top, then <i>define</i> the anchor at the very bottom. The   <code>[Neorg]</code> declaration points directly to the website, just like the definition does. It&apos;s like a   copy + paste of the link location without needing to type it out.</p><p>   Other than the declaration behavior described above anchors have no other special meaning and/or   semantics, and behave just like regular <a href='#h2-links'>links</a> do. This means they can be used as a   substitute for regular <a href='#h2-links'>links</a> should the user prefer the &quot;description + location&quot; syntax   versus the &quot;location + description&quot; syntax.</p><p>   Anchors (like <a href='#h2-links'>links</a>) may also be described by using <code>[...]</code>, in which case the syntax looks   like this: <code>[anchor name][anchor description]</code>.</p>\n</section>\n<section id='section-h2-inline-link-targets'>\n<h2 id='h2-inline-link-targets'>Inline Link Targets</h2>\n<p>   Finally, Norg also has the possibility of placing link targets at arbitrary inline positions in   your document. We call these <a href=''>inline link targets</a> which are formatted inside angled brackets:   <code>&lt;></code>.</p><pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n           One thing to mention is &lt;inline link targets> - they allow you to link to any location in a\n   document.\n\n   ...\n\n   Refer to {# inline link targets} if you are interested in learning more.\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<p>   An important thing to note is that since inline link targets are - well - inline, they cannot be   directly linked to with a dedicated char in the link syntax. To link to these syntax elements you   may <i>only</i> use <a href=''>the magic char</a>.</p><p>   Unlike <a href='#h2-links'>links</a> and <a href='#h2-anchors'>anchors</a>, <a href=''>inline link targets</a> may <i>not</i> have a description.</p><section id='section-h2-valid-invalid-examples'>\n<h2 id='h2-valid-invalid-examples'>Valid/Invalid Examples</h2>\n<section id='section-h3-valid-examples'>\n<h3 id='h3-valid-examples'>Valid Examples</h3>\n<pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {link}\n\n    {* \n    text}\n\n    {* text }\n\n    {* some\n    text   }\n\n    {:link:}\n\n    {:link:20}\n\n    {# link\n       text}\n\n    {* a link\n    to a heading}\n\n    {* text}[content ]\n\n    {* a\n    link to a heading}[with\n    a description]\n\n    [te\n    xt]{# linkable}\n\n    {* Link to {# headings}[heading]}[*markup*]\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n<section id='section-h3-invalid-examples'>\n<h3 id='h3-invalid-examples'>Invalid Examples</h3>\n<pre>\n    <code class=\"language-norg\">\n            {*text}\n\n    {:file:https://github.com}\n    {:file:/ file.txt}\n    {:file:@ Wednesday 30th Jan}\n\n    {\n    * text}\n\n    {\n        * text\n    }\n\n    {* text\n    }\n\n    { * text}\n\n    {* text}[\n        text\n    ]\n\n    {* text}[text\n    ]\n\n    {* text}[\n    text]\n\n    </code>\n</pre>\n\n</section>\n\n</section>\n<section id='section-h1-standard-library'>\n<h1 id='h1-standard-library'>Standard Library</h1>\n<p>  Norg comes loaded with a predetermined set of <a href='#h3-attributes'>attributes</a> and <a href='#h2-macro-tags'>macro tags</a> for  different <a href='#h1-layers'>layers</a> of the syntax.
